This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Origin

The project has been first designed to respond to a FreeCodeCamp challenge. As the challenges added up, I needed some place to gather the most "showable" of them.

## React

I chose to use react.js for this portfolio as I was studying this topic back then and needed to practice it. As it was my first project in react, I used Create React App to make it clean and easy.

## Design

The main inspiration for the design is from [this codepen.io](https://codepen.io/igorsheg/project/full/XNxbwj) project from [Igor Shegolev](https://codepen.io/igorsheg). Mine is not as clean and smooth regarding animation and UI, but I looked a way to have a quick and simple transition between sections and this felt good enought.
