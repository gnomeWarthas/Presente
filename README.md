This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Origin

The project has been first designed to respond to a FreeCodeCamp challenge. As the challenges added up, I needed some place to gather the most "showable" of them.

## React

I chose to use react.js for this portfolio as I was studying this topic back then and needed to practice it. As it was my first project in react, I used Create React App to make it clean and easy.
