### Stack

* **Front-end**
    * React.js
    * CSS

* **Back-end**
    * A js file to store projects info (keep it simple ;))
    * Markdown files to store the details of projects

### Features

This is a simple portfolio. There are three parts :

* About : A quick presentation of myself
* Work : some cards to present a list of project with the possibility to add a markdown file by project to describe it
* Contact : email, telephone, and social networks

### Design

The main inspiration for the design is from [this codepen.io](https://codepen.io/igorsheg/project/full/XNxbwj) project from [Igor Shegolev](https://codepen.io/igorsheg). Mine is not as clean and smooth regarding animation and UI, but I was looking for a way to have a quick and simple transition between sections and this felt good enought.
