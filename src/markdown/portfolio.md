My Portfolio project, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Stack

* **Front-end**
    * React.js
    * CSS

* **Back-end**
    * A js file to store projects info (keep it simple ;))
    * Markdown files to store the details of projects

### Features

I chose to use react.js for this portfolio as I was studying this topic back then and needed to practice it. As it was my first project in react, I used Create React App to make it clean and easy.

### Design

The main inspiration for the design is from [this codepen.io](https://codepen.io/igorsheg/project/full/XNxbwj) project from [Igor Shegolev](https://codepen.io/igorsheg). Mine is not as clean and smooth regarding animation and UI, but I looked a way to have a quick and simple transition between sections and this felt good enought.
